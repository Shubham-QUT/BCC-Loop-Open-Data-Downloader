This python repository provides an open source script to download and store real time data of traffic volume and occupancy of lanes at Brisbane City Council signalised intersections and approaches in CSV format. It need to be taken into consideration that not all signalised traffic intersections within Brisbane are operated by Brisbane City Council. This dataset contains only the Brisbane City Council operated signalised traffic intersection data.

To gain maximum benefit from this dataset you will have to use it in conjunction with another dataset Traffic Management — Intersection locations — reference. https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/traffic-signal-location-reference
